World Wind Subsurface Features 
by Nikolaos J. Hatzopoulos

This project aims to show subsurface features.

The theory:

if you use an object with this parameter:
gl.glDisable(GL.GL_DEPTH_TEST);
before it drawn you can see the object under the surface

by changing the object inner opacity you control the contrast with the surface

examples are:

Subsurface_1.java

I am using these data:
http://forecast.chapman.edu/nickhatz/data.zip

they are based on the first layer from this publication:
http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1421/

you need to convert the data to WGS84 first
and after that follow the worldwind instructions you will find in the forum
using global mapper to produce the bil files

the second example is Cylinders.java

I am using vector type data from GML
this is the thread I am explaining how to compile GDAL to support GML
in worldwind JDK:

there are some other examples I was experimainting for this tools

Have fun :)
